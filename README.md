# Pokemon-Pocket-Program

A console application to let pokemon player keep, view, check if they can evolve 
and evolve their pokemon characters. Each time when players caught a Pokemon, they 
can add the pokemon to this Pokemon Pocket program.

The pokemon evolution criteria in this application are the simplified version which means
that it could be different from the actual game that you have played in the Pokemon Go.
The evolution of a pokemon here is based on the number of the same pokemon type that
the player collected. 

The players can only add these 3 pokemon characters to the pocket

1. Pikachu – Lightning Bolt (2 to evolve)

2. Eevee – Run Away (3 to evolve)

3. Charmander – Solar Power (1 to evolve)

Pokemons should have the following attributes: name of pokemon, HP, Exp (Experience)
